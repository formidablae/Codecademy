  <!-- A section that describes the brown bear -->
  <p>Hey, my name is Michael, and there's little I find more exciting than bears! I've spent most of my young life traveling to the edges of Earth to take videos of these wonderful creatures.   <br /> <br />

  	Family, Country, Bears, <br /> <br />
